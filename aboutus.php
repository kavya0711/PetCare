            <h1>About Petcare</h1>
<p>At Petcare, our mission is to find loving forever homes for rescue pets and to provide resources and support for pet owners. We are a non-profit organization run by a dedicated team of animal lovers and volunteers.</p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Petcare was founded in 2015 by Mr. Yosh, who had a dream of creating a compassionate community for abandoned and surrendered pets. What started in Yosh's home with a few foster dogs and cats quickly grew into a network of foster families across the city. Over the years, we've expanded our services to include pet adoption events, affordable vet clinics, pet supply donations, and educational resources.</p>

<h2>Our Team</h2>
<p>Our passionate team consists of veterinarians, animal behaviorists, trainers, and countless volunteers who donate their time to ensuring each pet receives the care they need. We thoroughly vet all potential adopters to make perfect matches. Our foster families provide transitional homes for pets before they move to their forever families.</p>

<h2>Our Mission and Values</h2>
<p>At the core of Petcare is our unwavering commitment to animal welfare and responsible pet ownership. We believe that every animal deserves a safe, loving home, and we strive to educate and support pet owners throughout the entire adoption journey and beyond.</p>
<p>Our values include compassion, integrity, and a dedication to creating a more humane world for animals. We work tirelessly to promote the adoption of rescue pets, advocating against puppy mills and irresponsible breeding practices.</p>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>
<p>There are many ways to get involved with Petcare! Consider adopting your new best friend, fostering a pet, volunteering at events, or donating supplies and funds. Together we can make a difference, one paw at a time. <a href="volunteers.php">Learn more about how you can get involved.</a></p>
